  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

abstract = {In the narrow Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) band, avoiding wireless channel congestion is essential. Reporting vehicle kinematics in the Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM) only when there are notable changes in vehicle dynamics is a standardized approach to reducing bandwidth usage of periodic CAM messages that are exchanged between vehicles, and is called the CAM generation rule. However, in cellular vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, aperiodicity due to frequent omissions of periodic CAM raises problems of resource waste and instability in resource scheduling. The problem can be solved by reserving a resource only for actual CAM transmission times in the future. This article demonstrates that a neural network-based scheme can predict the next CAM generation times at an average accuracy of over 94%, which can be utilized for resource reservation under the CAM generation rule.}
